### Axel Greavette

Just a 17 y/o from Canada with a penchant for making things. 

I used to program *a lot*, but I kind of lost the groove over the course of the pandemic, and earlier this year I wiped my contributions. I'm trying to regain that curiousity and passion for code, but so far have only had midling success. 

In the meantime I've been focusing on high school, my career as an architectural designer, and doing things I love with the people I love.

Some other random facts:
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on delivering regular updates to my mobile app, [Payment Tracker](https://axel.gg/p/payment-tracker). 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning PERL, which has been loads of fun.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about what I've been listening too.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I really like Lil Wayne.
